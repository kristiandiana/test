*Hello and welcome to one of the 2024 McMaster GDSC Open Source project repos! Project Lead: [Kristian Diana](https://github.com/kristiandiana).*


## :loudspeaker: Attention :bangbang:

If **you** are interested in learning about how AI can make a difference in the healthcare field, then you are in the right place! The *ocular disease identifier* project involves developing a AI model that can predict whether common ocular diseases are present in a fundus image (see *Figure 1*).


## Project Overview :scroll: :bookmark_tabs: :page_with_curl: :open_book: :clipboard:

## Available Developer Positions :busts_in_silhouette:

Whether you are interested in machine learning, api development, or frontend development, this project has something for you! 

The team will comprise of two sub-teams; the Frontend & API sub-team, and the Backend sub-team. 
The Frontend & API sub-team will be responsible for the development of a web application, and python api. The Backend sub-team will be responsible for the development and training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow. For a more detailed overview of exactly what each sub-team will work on, please see the attached [Planning Document](./PLAN.md).

There will be ***3 available positions for each sub-team***. As a side note, being assigned to a specific sub-team does **not** necessarily mean you will not learn about the other, but it **is** where the bulk of your contributions will be made.
